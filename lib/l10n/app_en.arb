    "titreHome1": "A Centenary Review Facing the Challenges of Change",
    "paragraphe1": "The academic journal Hespéris was founded in 1921, only a year after the creation of the Institut des Hautes Etudes Marocaines in Rabat by the French protectorate authorities. The balance sheet of this publication until 1959 totals the production of 47 volumes, with one or more issues per year containing background articles, historical and geographical studies, unpublished documents, as well as reviews of new publications on Morocco and the Muslim West. The Spanish protectorate authorities in the Khalifian Zone (northern Morocco) had created a similar review entitled Tamuda, which published texts of the same nature as Hespéris in Spanish.",
    "paragraphe2": "After the independence of Morocco and the creation of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities in Rabat in 1957, Hespéris was merged with Tamuda, which appeared in Tetouan, in 1960 thus giving birth to Hespéris-Tamuda. It was the beginning of an academic and multidisciplinary journal devoted to the study of Morocco and the dissemination of knowledge relating to its society, history, culture and the social sciences of the Muslim West and the Mediterranean. Hespéris-Tamuda has been published annually since 1960 in one or more fascicles, with the emergence of articles and book reviews written in Arabic from 1991 onwards.",
    "paragraphe3": "While remaining faithful to its spirit of scientific rigor under the patronage of the current dean of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of Rabat Professor Jamal Eddine El Hani since the beginning of 2015, Hespéris-Tamuda has published original articles, papers on bibliographical  and archival studies and book reviews in Arabic, French, English and Spanish. The emphasis has been on the multidisciplinary enlargement of its scientific and editorial committee, both nationally and internationally, with the adoption of a new strategy based on openness to other fields of research in the human and social sciences. Morocco’s premium academic journal has been put on the rails of international indexing, as was the case recently with Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection located in Philadelphia (USA).",
    "paragraphe4": "Published by the Faculty of Arts and Humanities (Mohammed V University Rabat, Morocco), Hespéris-Tamuda (Annual ISSN: 0018-1005) has been selected to feature in the products and services of Clarivate Analytics since 2016. The journal has been indexed in the category titled Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI). In the future, Hespéris-Tamuda could be submitted for inclusion in other Clarivate Analytics products and services to be able to better meet the needs of researchers around the world. In this year (2021), the journal celebrated the centenary of its existence with new scientific activities, in collaboration with major partners, in Morocco, Europe, and the United States.",
    "titreAbout1": "or the March of History",
    "paragraphe_1_About": "To create a scientific journal is to create a way of being alive. But since man is only a creature, it is not enough for him to say “be” to something for it to be. When launching a journal, developers never know if it will disappear after a few deliveries/releases or if it will register in time and survive.",
    "paragraphe_2_About": "This may have been the case with Hespéris. Held on the baptismal font by the highest authorities of the French Protectorate, endowed with necessary material means, animated by a team of scientists who were each in his specialty a figurehead, Hespéris, it is true, had, at the beginning, all the assets for it. But there was also a good chance it would fizzle out.",
    "paragraphe_3_About": "It was too closely linked, at its birth in 1921, to the work of the Protectorate. The goal was to continue to probe into the mysteries of the protected society; taking over a country necessitated the possession of its secrets. This work was first conducted by the French Scientific Mission since 1904.",
    "paragraphe_4_About": "Its results were made known to the public in a special periodical, called Archives marocaines until 1936, then Archives berbères of which it appeared only a few issues. The creation of a new journal was intended to consolidate efforts and better cover the colonial enterprise in the process of stabilization after the Great War. The name of Hespéris was obvious. It was the term by which the Greeks designated ancient Morocco.",
    "paragraphe_5_About": "In this land teeming with life and greenery, Hercules lived one of his adventures. In fact, “Hespéris” in Greek means sunset or the west. This is the exact translation of the Arabic word “Ma Ghrib.” Playing on words, the colonizer let appear the desire that tapped him to detach Morocco from its Arab-Muslim roots to better fix it in the movement of Europe.",
    "paragraphe_6_About": "Early on, however, the journal proved viable. Objective scientific research took precedence over the colonial enterprise. Scholars of the caliber of a Lévi-Provençal, a Georges Colin, or an Émile Laoust were not men to let themselves be dragged out of the truth. In addition, the journal was born at a convenient time. It responded to a dual cultural need. On the protector’s side, the time had come to move from punctual intelligence research to in-depth scientific research. On the side of the protected, it was necessary to question themselves by opening the school of modernity. Historians like ʿAbderraḥmāne Ibn Zaydāne, Abbāss Ibn Brāhim At-taʿārjī or Moḥammed Dāwūd were at work.",
    "paragraphe_7_About": "Hespéris lived devoting itself to the study of Morocco and its Maghreb and Andalusian environment. The orientation that the founding team gave it put the review out of the time allotted to the Protectorate. The Journal became by its holding one of the facades of the twentieth-century Moroccan. To continue to assume the publication was one of the responsibilities of the Faculty of Letters, created within the University Mohammed V, after the independence (1957). A team was formed where, progressively, took the step of the Moroccan researchers. Once Morocco regained its territorial unity, it was decided to merge into a single journal Hespéris, which was published in the former French zone, and Tamuda, which appeared in the former Spanish zone. Hence the new name of Hespéris-Tamuda. “Tamuda” is an ancient Amazigh village whose remains are visible to the southeast of Tetouan.",
    "paragraphe_8_About": "The linchpin of this new stage and this new synthesis was our late colleague, Germain Ayache. Who better than he could ensure the continuation of such a publication and maintain it at a higher scientific level? Who better than he, an anti-colonialist militant suppressed for his commitment and his struggle, could safeguard past loyalties and create new ones? Associate of the French university and Moroccan Jew, proud of his Arab-Berber culture, he was able to ensure, with tenacity and self-sacrifice, the link between colonial time and the era of sovereignty recovered.",
    "paragraphe_9_About": "After his death in 1990, another team I have the honor to coordinate, was formed to carry the torch. We are the generation of the promoters who must assume the double heritage. We inherited a historical school doubly rooted in Andalusian culture and in the Moroccan tradition. We are the grandsons of Abu-ʿObeyd Al-Bakrī or Ibn Al-Khatīb as much as those of Ibn Abī Zarʿ or Abū Al-Qāsim Az-Zayyānī. But we are also grateful disciples of our French and Spanish masters who have trained us in modern methodology and made us know the tremendous scientific capital that is theirs from Herodotus to the current production that keeps opening up new tracks to investigation.",
    "paragraphe_10_About": "Faithful to this double heritage, we wanted the journal to be as much a means of publicizing Moroccan research in the human sciences as a meeting place for foreign researchers. It can be written in four languages: Arabic, French, Spanish and English. It is another pledge to maintain the literary and methodological rigor at a high level. So it is always awaited and read by the international scientific community.",
    "paragraphe_11_About": "Moreover, the Faculty of Letters has decided to republish since the first deliveries. To possess the complete collection is to have at hand a sort of encyclopedia providing precise data on almost everything concerning Morocco in particular and the Muslim West in general, in terms of history, geography, sociology or linguistics.",
    "paragraphe_12_About": "Thanks to this Faculty, one can get a detailed and global perspective of ​​the Moroccan personality. The parable of the tree, which was loved by King Hassan II, finds its various justifications. The African roots, the junction with the European shore since ancient times, the links with the East, before and after Islam, are attested in length of pages and booklets. Hespéris-Tamuda is the scientific materialization of this parable that says in a word what has been the past and what must be the future. In other words, a destiny, where the past, loaded with determination, is a guarantee of the future. All in all, the colonial page was a kind of storm as violent as fleeting that allowed us to make a new start in history. We learned to look at ourselves with a critical eye. Hespéris-Tamuda is one of the most fruitful illustrations of this approach. That’s why it is still alive. Time has made it a kind of institution. By publishing this special issue on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of its creation, the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of Rabat, editor of the journal, wants to highlight the weight of this institution.",

    "paragraphe_1_Recommandation": "Contributions submitted for publication in the journal are unpublished. They have not been published previously either in print or on the Internet in any other language and have not been submitted to other journals at the same time. Manuscripts must be written in the original language (Arabic, French, English, Spanish) in electronic format in Word format, with the following parameters: font Times New Roman, 12 points (09 in the notes, which must appear at the bottom of the page, numbered in correlation with Arabic numerals), simple interlinear separation (in text and notes) and 3 cm of lateral margins. The last page should include the summary and keywords, all translated into English, French, Spanish, and Arabic. The length of the abstract will be between 100 and 150 words and will describe the purpose of the research, the methodology used, the most outstanding results and the main conclusions. Send your articles to the following email address: (khalidbensrhir@gmail.com)",
    "paragraphe_2_Recommandation": "Each article will be evaluated by the editorial committee and, in case of agreement, it will be sent anonymously to at least two ad hoc readers. The latter may either recommend accepting the article as it is, or ask for modifications, or recommend not to retain the article. In case of request for modifications, the article will be submitted a second time to the evaluators",
    "paragraphe_3_Recommandation": "In addition to the detailed style sheet below, we kindly ask our contributors to consult the last three issues of Hespéris-Tamuda published after 2016 to become familiar with the system recently adopted by Hespéris-Tamuda. This system is a bit difficult to apply at the beginning, especially for manuscripts written in French, Spanish and Arabic.",
    "paragraphe_4_Recommandation": "Use the Chicago Manual of Style Reference System. Be careful, there are two citation systems linked to the Chicago style: the classic method and the author / date method. For the sake of precision and clarity we have opted for the classic method (or traditional) that uses reference notes at the bottom of the page and not at the end of the document, which return the reader to a bibliography.",
    "paragraphe_5_Recommandation": "Each article must be accompanied by an identification sheet of the quadrilingual article (French, English, Spanish and Arabic) with the title of the article (in four languages), the names of authors in the desired order, a short notice of presentation of each of the authors (5 lines maximum), a summary of 100 or 150 signs with 5-6 key words (in the four languages).",
    "paragraphe_6_Recommandation": "It is essential to use automatic continuous numbering with the footnotes. Note calls are preferably placed at the end of the sentence and simply inserted in the text (no parentheses). The note call in the text always comes after the punctuation mark. Example: “as Ibn Khaldoun wrote.” 8 In the footnote itself, the automatically generated number is followed by a space and then the contents of the note. The title of the article and the subtitles can not have a footnote.",
    "paragraphe_7_Recommandation": "The bibliography must be presented in alphabetical order. All sources are listed in the alphabetical order of the name of the author, regardless of the type of document (articles, books, websites, etc.). If the same author appears several times in the bibliography, we organize its works from the most recent to the oldest. The bibliography is single-spaced and requires a paragraph (i.e. tab) of approximately 1 cm at the beginning of the second line and subsequent lines of each reference.",
    "paragraphe_8_Recommandation": "The photographs and graphics that accompany the text should be of as good quality as possible (300 dpi minimum). Photocopies are not accepted. The photographs must be provided as scanned files in high definition, in .jpg format. The graphics are the subject of a separate file from the text and are transmitted as an image in .jpg format. The tables are designed directly in the article file (Word).",
    "paragraphe_9_Recommandation": "Specify the legend, the reference of origin and the placement in the text of the illustrations. Provide permission to reproduce and preferably use royalty-free iconography. The illustrations must be introduced by captions in the form of a short description or the title of the work. Legends start with Figure and are followed by a number and then a dot. The numbering is sequential from the beginning. Rather than including the source in a bibliography, it is inserted directly into the legend, following the description if there is one, or as the only legend. It must contain the name of the person who produced the illustration, its title, the date of production and the provenance of the illustration, quoted according to the appropriate method for the format of the source (book, journal, periodical, etc.) . If it is an image subject to copyright and permission has been obtained for reuse, it must be mentioned by adding Reproduced with permission of ... followed by the source from where comes the picture",
